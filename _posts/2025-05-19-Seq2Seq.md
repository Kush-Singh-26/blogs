# Sequence-to-Sequence Models

- Seq2Seq models are a neural network architecture designed to transform one sequence (of text) to another sequence.
- The input and output are both sequences and can be of varying lengths.
- These models can be used for many tasks like :
    - Machine Translation
    - Text Summarization
    - Speech Recognition
    - Image Captioning

- This post will focus on **Machine Translation** task.

## Architecture

- It consists of a **Decoder** and an **Encoder** network.

### Encoder

- The encoder processes the entire input sequence and encodes it into a context vector (also called the hidden state).
- This context vector contains **compressed information** about the whole input sequence.
- This context vector is represented by the 
- It is built using RNNs(LSTM or GRU).


```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.n_layers = n_layers
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout=dropout)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, src):
        embedded = self.dropout(self.embedding(src))
        outputs, (hidden, cell) = self.rnn(embedded) # embedded = [src length, batch size, embedding dim]

        return hidden, cell
```

### Decoder

- The decoder is also built using RNNs(LSTM or GRU) and is responsible for generating the output sequence token-by-token.
- The decoder's initial hidden state is set to the final hidden state of the encoder.
- It starts with a special start-of-sequence token <SOS> and generates one word at a time.
- The decoder uses its own previous outputs as inputs at each step (during inference).
- During training, a technique called **teacher forcing** is used.

```python
class Decoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, output_dim, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout):
        super().__init__()
        self.output_dim = output_dim
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.n_layers = n_layers

        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(output_dim, embedding_dim)
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, n_layers, dropout=dropout)
        self.fc_out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, input, hidden, cell):
        # input shape: [batch_size]
        if input.dim() == 2:
            input = input.squeeze(0)  # Ensure shape is [batch_size]

        input = input.unsqueeze(0)  # Reshape to [1, batch_size] for time-step=1
        embedded = self.dropout(self.embedding(input))  # [1, batch_size, embedding_dim]

        output, (hidden, cell) = self.rnn(embedded, (hidden, cell))
        prediction = self.fc_out(output.squeeze(0))  # [batch_size, output_dim]

        return prediction, hidden, cell
```

### Combined Seq2Seq Model

- These 2 classes are used to build the complete *Seq2Seq* class.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import random

class Seq2Seq(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, device):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder
        self.device = device

    def forward(self, src, trg, teacher_forcing_ratio=0.5):
        # src = [src_len, batch_size]
        # trg = [trg_len, batch_size]

        batch_size = trg.shape[1]
        trg_len = trg.shape[0]
        trg_vocab_size = self.decoder.output_dim

        # Tensor to store decoder outputs
        outputs = torch.zeros(trg_len, batch_size, trg_vocab_size).to(self.device)

        # Encode the source sequence
        hidden, cell = self.encoder(src)

        # First input to the decoder is the <sos> token
        input = trg[0, :]  # [batch_size]

        for t in range(1, trg_len):
            # Decode one token
            output, hidden, cell = self.decoder(input, hidden, cell)

            # Store the prediction
            outputs[t] = output

            # Decide whether to use teacher forcing
            teacher_force = random.random() < teacher_forcing_ratio

            # Get the highest predicted token
            top1 = output.argmax(1)

            # Use actual next token or predicted token as next input
            input = trg[t] if teacher_force else top1

        return outputs
```

#### **Teacher Forcing** 
- Feeding the actual target token instead of the predicted one to help the model learn faster.
- Prevents the model from compounding its own early mistakes during training.
- At each time step `t` use the correct target prediction or the model's previous prediction based on a **teacher_forcing_ratio**.

```python
if random.random() < teacher_forcing_ratio:
    input = trg[t]       # teacher forcing
else:
    input = model_pred   # use model's own prediction
```

- Too much teacher forcing might cause model to struggle at inference time.
- Too little teacher forcing will result in slower training.

- Thus, *scheduled sampling* can be used  : start with a high ratio and gradually decrease it over epochs.

## Perplexity

- It is a metric to evaluate how well a language model predicts a sequence.
- It measures **how surprised the model is by the actual target sequence**.

> Lower perplexity = less surprise = more confident predictions = better model.

- If the model assigns probabilities $ p_1 , p_2 , p_3 , ... , p_T $ to a sequence of length T, the perplexity is :

- $$ \text{Perplexity} = exp(- \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t = 1} ^ T \log p_t) $$


- If loss function used is `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` which computes the negative **log-likelihood**, it can be exponentiated to get perplexity.

```python
loss = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(output, target)
perplexity = torch.exp(loss) # np.exp(loss)
```

## Beam Search

- It is a decoding strategy used to generate sequences. 
- Instead of choosing only the top-1 prediction at each step (as in greedy decoding), it keeps track of the **top k most probable sequences** at each step (where **k is the beam width**).

- At each time step:
    1. Expand each sequence in the beam with all possible next tokens.
    2. Keep only the `top-k` sequences based on total log probability.
    3. Repeat until max length or end-of-sequence (`<eos>`) token is reached.

# Drawbacks of Seq2Seq models

1. Entire input sequence is compressed into a single fixed-size (dimension of hidden state) context vector.
    - This causes the model to struggle with long / complex sequences.

2. RNNs being sequential by nature doesn't allow parallization easily.

3. Beam search during inference adds computational overhead.

4. These models don't learn the explicit word-to-word alignment between input and output tokens.

## Solution

To tackle the above drawbacks **Attention** and **Transformer** architecture are used.

## Shebang
- `#!/bin/bash`
- It tells the system to use `/bin/bash` as the interpreter for this script
## Variables
- Can contain a number, a character or a string.
- Can contain '_'.
- Case sensitive.
- Value assignment through '='. No space permitted between =.
- eg.
``` shell
name='Kush'
age=26
h_w='Hello World'
```
---

- `((...))` tells Bash to interpret the expression as arithmetic operation 
``` shell
a=1
b=4
echo $((a+b))
```
---
- ' \ ' is used to escape special character meaning.
``` shell
PRICE_PER_APPLE=5
echo "The price of an Apple today is: \$HK $PRICE_PER_APPLE"
```

>Output :  The price of an Apple today is: $HK 5

- "${}" is used to avoid ambiguity.

- `` can assign a command's output to a variable
eg.
``` shell
FILELIST=`ls`
```

## Use of `$`
- access value of a variable
    - `echo "hello, $name"` 
- execute a command `$(command)`
- performing arithmetic operations `$((a+b))`
- positional reference `$1 $2` 

## Passing Arguments to the Script
- Inside the script, the $1 variable references the first argument in the command line, $2 the second argument and so forth.
- The variable $0 references to the current script.

eg.
``` shell
#!/bin/bash
echo "Current file :"$0
echo "Name : $1"
echo "Age : $2"
```

> Output : user1:~$ ./temp.sh Kush 20<br>
Current file :./temp.sh<br>
Name : Kush<br>
Age : 20

- The variable `$#` holds the number of arguments passed to the script

- The variable `$@` holds a space delimited string of all arguments passed to the script

## Arrays
- `my_array=(apple banana "Fruit Basket" orange)`
- `echo ${#array[@]}` : given the size of the array (4)
- ``echo ${my_array[3]}` : orange

- `my_array[4]="carrot"` : value assignment without a $ and curly brackets
- `echo ${#my_array[@]}` : 5
- `echo ${my_array[${#my_array[@]}-1]} ` : carrot

## Piping
- `|`
- used to pass the output of one command as input to another command. This allows you to chain commands together efficiently.
- **Syntax :** `command1 | command2 | command3`
- `ls -l | grep "txt"`
    - `ls -l` lists files in long format.
    - `grep "txt"` filters the list to show only files containing "txt" in their names.
    - List Files and Search for a Pattern

## Output Redirection
- `>` write to a file
- `>>` append to a file

## Input Redirection
- `<` redirects input from a file
- `cat > file.txt` = `cat file.txt`
- `cat > file.txt`
    - Bash opens file.txt for reading.
    - It redirects the content of file.txt into cat as if you typed it from the keyboard.
    - cat reads from standard input (stdin) and prints it.
- `<<` redirects a block of text as input
- **Syntax :**
``` shell
command <<EOF
text line 1
text line 2
EOF
```

- `<<<` redirects a single string as input
-  `cat <<< "Hello, World!"` o/p  Hello, World!

## `wc`
- **Syntax :** `wc [options] [file]`
- options :
    - `-l` count lines
    - `-w` count words

- `wc -w < textfile.txt` o/p = 3
- `wc -w <<< "hello world I am Kush"` o/p = 6

## if, elif, else statement
``` shell
#!/bin/bash
if [ ${1,,} = kush ]; then
        echo "welcome"
elif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then
        echo "enter your username"
else
        echo "I don't know you"
fi
```
- `[  ]` = test command
    - use `-gt , -eq , -lt , [...] && [...]`
    - `$a , $b` are used because a and b are treated like string
- `${1}` = first command line argument
- `${1,,}` = converts the argument to lowercase
- `fi` to close the if block
- `((...))` can be used for numeric comparisions
    - this allows use of `< , > , = , && can be used inside the parenthesis`
    - a and b can be used without $ because they are treated like variables
---
- `=` is used for comparing string
- `-eq` is used for numbers

## CASE
``` shell
#!/bin/bash
case ${1,,} in
        kush | administrator)
                echo "hello"
                ;;
        help)
                echo "enter username"
                ;;
        *)
                echo "enter valid username"
esac
```
- `|` is used as OR
- `;;` is used to close a case
- `xyz)` ' ) ' is used to end a case name
- `*)` = _wildcard_
    - it matches anything not covered above
- `esac` is used to close case block

## Arrays
- `names=("Bob" "Peter" "$USER" "Big Bad John")`
- `names=([0]="Bob" [1]="Peter" [20]="$USER" [21]="Big Bad John")`
- `names=()` creates empty array
- `echo ${names[@]}` prints the content
- `echo ${names}` prints only the first element
- ` echo ${names[3]}` prints element at index 3
- 0 indexing
    ### Associative Array
    - Like map in C++ or hashmap in java
    - `declare -A freq  `
    ``` shell
    for num in "${arr[@]}"
    do
        ((freq[$num]++))
    done
    ```
    - To print
    ``` shell
    for key in "${!freq[@]}"
    do
        echo "$key: ${freq[$key]}"
    done
    ```
- Input array : `read -a arr`

## for loop
``` shell
#!/bin/bash
names=(one two three four five six)
for item in ${names[@]}; do
        echo $item | wc -c
done
```
- prints the size of each word in the array

## Functions
``` shell
#!/bin/bash
up="before"
since="function"
echo $up
echo $since
showuptime(){
        local up=$(uptime -p | cut -c4-)
        local since=$(uptime -s)
        cat << EOF
----
this machine has been up for ${up}
It has been running since ${since}
----
EOF
}
showuptime
echo $up
echo $since
```
- `local <varname>` allows to use a variable locally in a function without altering the global variable

## while loop
``` shell
while [ condition ]; do
    # commands to execute
done
```
